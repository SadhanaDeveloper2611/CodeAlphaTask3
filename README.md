For Task 3 of my internship, I developed a Music Player application using JavaScript. This project involved several key features:

✨ User Interface Design: Crafted a responsive and intuitive user interface for easy navigation and control.

✨ Audio Controls: Implemented essential audio functionalities such as play, pause, stop, next, previous, and volume control.

✨ Playlist Management: Allowed users to create and manage playlists, ensuring a smooth and personalized music experience.

✨ Dynamic Loading: Enabled dynamic loading of audio files, ensuring efficient performance and a seamless user experience.

✨ Progress Tracking: Integrated a progress bar to visually track the playback of the current song.

This project not only strengthened my JavaScript skills but also taught me the importance of user experience in application development
